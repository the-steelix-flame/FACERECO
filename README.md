# FACERECO
This project is a Facial Recognition System designed to automate employee attendance tracking in organizations. It leverages high-definition cameras and advanced facial recognition algorithms to accurately identify employees as they enter the premises.


Key features include:

Real-Time Face Recognition: Identifies employees in real-time using a webcam.

Attendance Logging: Automatically records entry times for accurate attendance tracking.

Database Management: Allows administrators to add/remove employees and securely store face embeddings.

Admin Interface: Provides a web-based dashboard for managing employee data and viewing attendance logs.

Scalable and Secure: Designed to handle large datasets with robust data protection measures.

Tech Stack:
Programming Language: Python

Libraries: OpenCV, face_recognition, dlib, DeepFace, NumPy, Pandas, Flask

Database: SQLite (or PostgreSQL for larger datasets)

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap (for admin interface)

Deployment: Docker, Heroku/AWS/Google Cloud

Key Features:
Efficient Employee Identification:
Uses advanced facial recognition algorithms to accurately identify employees.

Real-Time Processing:
Low-latency face recognition for quick and smooth entry processing.

Attendance Tracking:
Automatically logs entry times into a database for accurate attendance records.

Admin Dashboard:
A user-friendly interface for managing employee data and viewing attendance logs.

Security and Privacy:
Encrypts sensitive data and ensures only authorized personnel can access the system.

How It Works:
Data Collection:
High-quality images of employees are collected and stored in the data/employees/ directory.

Preprocessing:
Images are normalized, and faces are detected and aligned using OpenCV.

Face Encoding:
Face embeddings are generated using the face_recognition library and stored in a database.

Real-Time Recognition:
The system captures video frames from a webcam, detects faces, and compares them with stored embeddings.

Attendance Logging:
Recognized employees are logged into the database with their entry times.

Admin Interface:
Administrators can manage employee data and view attendance logs through a Flask-based web application.

Installation:
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy
git clone https://github.com/your-username/facial-recognition-system.git
cd facial-recognition-system
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the system:

For real-time face recognition:

bash
Copy
python src/face_recognition.py
For the admin interface:

bash
Copy
python src/app.py
Usage:
Add employee images to the data/employees/ directory.

Run the face recognition script to start the system.

Access the admin dashboard at http://localhost:5000 to manage employee data and view attendance logs.
